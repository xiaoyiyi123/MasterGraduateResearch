Study on Feeling Analysis based on House-Tree-Person Drawing Test with Deep Learning.   

## Quickly understanding
In this research, we aimed to analyze human feeling information with a new, interesting method. Actually, the existing method has been tested that they could be effectively used to detect human feeling information. But there are still some limitations that questions in those methods are a little privacy and could let test takers feel pressure to join test. So we want to propose a interesting method so that to overcome the psychological pressure and praise to get true feeling information.  

##  Research Process  
### Conduct a psychological experiment.   
We used a Chinese online system called [Wen JuanXing online system](https://www.wjx.cn)  to conduct this experiment.      
The contents including three sections:    
Basic information   
LSNS-6 questions    
House-Tree-Person Drawing Test

After serveral weeks, we collected the test data and all the data are stored as an excel file.      
There are four sections: the first column is the answers of basic information, the second column is answers of LSNS-6 qeustions, the thrid column is the answers of HTP images here all those images are stored as url as a results of online address, and the last is the scores of LSNS-6 scale.

### Process and Analyze the collect data.       
Firstly, remove useless data. Here useless data means the data missing meaningful HTP images. After that we got a total 74 useful data.     
Then, based on the scores of the LSNS-6 scale, we classified those HTP images into two groups. The HTP image with the score below 12 was put into the high social isolation risk group otherwise it was put into the low social isolation risk group.       
Next, we analyzed these two groups' images to find the similarities and differences and also refered to the related research about Huse-Tree-Person drawing test
